### waveform_modified.ipynb: notebook to generate waveform (modified version) data and to run least squares on it.

The waveform (modified version) data sets are saved as .csv files which are named according to the following rule:

WF_{data_name: train or test}_m{number of instances / 1000}_sig{sigma_0 * 10}_dg{Delta_g * 10}.csv

Example: baseline test set (m=30 000, sigma0 = 1.25, Delta_g = 0.5)
WF_test_m30_n20_sig125_dg5.csv

Note: the data set will actually contain 43 columns (21 measurement, 21 uncertainties, 1 label)


### CNN1D_WF.ipynb: notebook to run CNN1D models in waveform (modified version) data.

### CNN2D_WF.ipynb: notebook to run CNN2D images model in waveform (modified version) data.

Note: to run CNN1D_WF and (specially) CNN2D_WF, it is highly recommended to connect to a GPU.
